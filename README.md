# Interactive Rating Component

## Hi hi! 👋

This project is a solution for a challenge developed by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). To start the challenge, we receive screenshots of the final product and some guidelines on style and expectations on the usability. The rest was up to me, what is very exciting and mildly terrifying. 🙃
I particularly enjoy completing these type of challenges as they are a great opportunity to develop my skills in a similar context to real world workflow. Once I was done, I also published it on the Frontend Mentor platform and had the chance to receive feedback from the community. Feel free to visit [my profile at Frontend Mentor]( https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ga-bri-ela). 

## The Challenge 🧩

According to Frontend Mentor, to complete the [Interactive Rating Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) Challenge, the users using the component should be to:
-	Select and submit a number rating
-	See the “Thank you” card state after submitting a rating
-	See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

This is the first screen, where the user can select the rating. The hover state represented in orange and the focused in gray.

This is the second screen, where the user can see the rating they have selected and a thank you message.

## Technologies 💻

This project was built using JavaScript ES6, CSS and HTML.

## Personal take-aways 👩‍💻

This was the first challenge I have completed from Frontend Mentor and the first time I have coded something 100% independently. It really made me realize the gaps that I had in my CSS knowledge. During my process of learning how to code, I was just so excited to finally get my hands dirty with JavaScript that I had been overlooking the power and importance of CSS. So, I am very grateful for this project for making me realize that. 
It was also the first time I published some of my code for the world to see and comment. And it turns out that I have received helpful comments from kind strangers regarding good coding practices and learned a lot from that. I guess the internet isn’t the horrible place of humiliation that I thought it was. (Well, it is. But now I know there are good corners too!)

## Continued development 👩‍🎓

This simple project has no intent other than serving as a practice project and a steppingstone leading me towards more complex applications. So, summing up, the code is not great, but it works, and I have learned a lot by building it. Things that I will be applying in other projects, as I am ready for bigger, greater (and more exciting!) things.  🚀
